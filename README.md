Some pure data patches for the less experienced users.

EgoArp6 is a simple arpeggiated synth on 4 octaves with 4 notes chords selector and controls for speed(speed), arp lenght(octave), tone, attack and decay.

EgoGlitch6 is a double looper with a gltich effect incorporated on the first repeater. The loops are not synchronized.

EgoVerb6 is a reverb effect base on [rev3~] with a double random parameter selection. Suited for watery ambient effects.

To run the effects simply open them into a patch as an object, for example [EgoArp6].
A copy of the effect patch must be stored in the same directory of the patch where the effect is utilised.
The orange/red dots at the top/bottom of the effects are the audio input/outputs, to be connected to the [adc~] [dac~] objects.
